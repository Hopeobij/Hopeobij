<p align="left"> As a Data Analyst, I was responsible for developing a product comparison dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of the company's product performance in terms of sales. Nestlé is the largest food company in the world, marketing over 8,500 brands and 30,000 products globally, and operating nearly 500 factories across five continents with over 200,000 employees worldwide. With this extensive reach and diverse portfolio, it is crucial for Nestlé to have a clear understanding of its product performance to make informed decisions about its expansion plans...<p>
  
<p align="left">The product comparison dashboard I have developed enables Nestlé to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each product, identify areas for improvement, and highlight the products that are contributing the most to the company's bottom line. With this valuable insight, Nestlé can make data-driven decisions regarding its expansion plans, including identifying potential areas for growth, determining which products to invest in, and identifying any products that may need to be discontinued or improved.<p>

<p align="left">  The airport dataset is vast and contains information on various countries and continents. As a data analyst, I have been tasked to analyze this dataset, focusing on five random countries and creating a separate table for each country in SQL. The aim is to explore the dataset and understand the airport activities in the selected countries, identify any trends or patterns, and propose recommendations for improvements.<p>
